## Objectives

The goal of this module is to provide an overview of all the key tools for transforming a data frame.

Learn a consistent way to organize your data in R using a system called tidy data. 

## What data?

Tidy Tuesday
Make their own dataframe?
Fun data? or science data?

## Approaches

Base R
- Positional indices
- Logical indices (subset())
- Ordering dataframes
- Adding columns and rows (cbind(), rbind())
- Convert to a data type/data structure of interest
- Merging data frames (merge())
- Reshaping data frames (reshape2: decast - long to wide, melt - wide to long)

tidyverse
- “Row” verbs: filter, arrange, distinct
- “Columns” verbs: mutate, select, rename, relocate
- “Groups” verbs: group_by, summarize, slice
- Ungrouping, .by
- The pipe (“and then”)
- pivot_longer() & pivot_wider()

Case studies

## Meeting cadence?
- Biweekly?

## Assignments
- Recreation example
    - Can you transform the data to look like this example?
- Creativity Example
    - (I don’t think this is applicable this module?)
- Use any of the methods we talked about 
    - Create data 
        - Certain # of columns, some required, some not
            - For example, names, ages, etc
- Troubleshooting code 
    - Create script that breaks and have them fix it
